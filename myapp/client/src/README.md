The left side of the navbar contains the app name (OSNY APP) followed by its logo. 

The right side of the navbar contains two buttons, About and GitHub.
Clicking the GitHub button redirects the user to the project home page, which is [here](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY).
Clicking the About button redirects the user to the project ReadMe, which is [here](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/blob/master/README.md)
